				<p>Thanks for making your way here to the online demo!</p>
				<p>If you're a vendor, I recommend that you first visit the <a href="?i=1">Live Demos</a> page in order to listen to a number of live, acoustic cover songs that I recorded at Oliver's Tavern in Essex, CT. But don't worry about having to finish listening before moving on to something else. The music will continue to play as you navigate to other areas of the Demo Site.</p>
