			<p><strong>Jillian &amp; Steven</strong> are a husband and wife duo who have been performers since they were young. After meeting their first night at Marist College
			in the fall of 1999, they soon began dating, got engaged and were married in June of 2004.</p>
			<p>With their love for music and entertaining, they discovered they could
			share these common interests together creating their DJ business.</p>
			<p>After 12 years together, they are truly &quot;Lucky in Love.&quot;</p>
			<p><strong>Jillian</strong> holds a BA in Elementary &amp; Special Education and a MA in Curriculum &amp; Instruction. She has taken time off from teaching
			to raise her son and daughter, and embark on the DJing business. Jillian has been involved in choruses and performing in musicals throughout her life. She enjoys listening to and performing varieties of music.</p>
			<blockquote>
				I'm so excited to be working with Steven to share the many special moments and joyous events in people's lives as DJs.
			</blockquote>
			<p><strong>Steven</strong> is no stranger to the performing arts. As a singer / songwriter for the past 14 years, he had the opportunity to perform with many national artists including <em>Duncan Sheik</em>, <em>Spin Doctors</em>, <em>Violent Femmes</em> and <em>American Hi-Fi</em>.  Though he's a seasoned performing artist, Steven is no stranger to DJing either.  While a teenager he would assist <em>DJ Spinners</em> with DJing weddings and parties, and more recently he was a DJ in Connecticut with <em>Travis Winkley Entertainment</em>, and continues to help out there whenever needed.</p>
			<blockquote>
				Working together with Jillian, doing what we both love to do, has been a long time coming. I can't think of a more perfect partner, not only in life, but in business as well!
