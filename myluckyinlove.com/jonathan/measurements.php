<b>Timeline:</b><br />
<i>Wednesday, August 22nd</i><br />
3:00am - Contractions begin (Although Jillian isn't aware at this point that they are contractions. She goes into work and spends 11 hours setting up her room, all the while in labor!)<br />
6:45pm - Jillian finally submits to contacting the doctor because of her &quot;lower abdominal pains&quot;.<br />
8:10pm - We settle into St. Mary's Hospital, room 3113, in Waterbury, Connecticut.<br />

10:45pm - Second examination results in 4cm dialated, 90% effaced.<br />
<i>Thursday, August 23rd</i><br />
12:42am - Third examination results in 5.5cm dialated, we're now 100% effaced.<br />
1:15am - Epidural administered. (Note: Although the pain was discomforting, the decision was made because Mommy was getting very exhausted from the contractions.)<br />
1:45am - Fourth examination results in 8cm dialated.<br />
2:30am - Fifth examination results in 9cm dialated.<br />
3:00am - Sixth examination ends with an induced water break.<br />
