				<p><strong>Michelle &amp; Dylan Johnson	</strong></p>
				<blockquote>Thank you so much for exceeding our expectations on our wedding day! We couldn't have asked for more. From the day we met, you made us feel completely confident in our choice of entertainment, and all throughout the planning process we could relax knowing we were in good hands. Jillian, you were so attentive to every little detail and very easy to communicate with. We were also very impressed by Steven's talent; as he sang and strummed while guests were being seated, his music put both of our pre-wedding jitters completely at ease. Many of our guests commented on the special touch this added to our big day. In fact, our friends and family still rave about the music (both live and DJ-ed) that we had at our wedding. We are so very happy to recommend <em><strong>Lucky in Love DJ Productions</strong></em> to everyone we know! Thanks again!!</blockquote>

				<blockquote>We just wanted to thank you for the wonderful job you did at our party.  Thank you for being so reachable and organized during the planning process, I really enjoyed working with you... We were happy with the way everything went at the party-we honestly could not have asked for better!   You were present and kept things running smoothly but were not intrusive.  Everyone had a great time and your music was a huge part of what made it such a fantastic party.  You kept the dance floor busy all night.  We will highly recommend you to others!</blockquote>

				<p><strong>Maryann &amp; Cas	</strong></p>
				<blockquote>...Thank you so much for being such a fantastic, memorable part of our big day... I can't wait to see the video as so much of the day seems like a blur to me-but I do remember hearing your voice and thinking how happy I was to have you there - it was perfect! So many people have complimented us on our ceremony, especially your performance, including (most importantly) Cas, who had sort of given up on having a vocalist or any live music back in November. He has not stopped telling me how impressed he was with you and what a great choice I made (haha it was easy!...)</blockquote>
